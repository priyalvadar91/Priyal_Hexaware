oday i have explained the 2 main commands of Git.
1. Git Merge
2. Git Rebase

Both are used to integrated the changes of one branch in another. But the way they work is different.

Git Merge, preserve the commit history, while Git Rebase re-writes the commit history.
Git Merge add new commit but Git rebase do not add any new commit.

Whenever we work in Public branch, try to avoid Git Rebase.
